            I am including this page because the URL of this page was the
            original URL of the project, and the URL that was made public
            on my teacher's website to my class. Thus, this URL exists in
            places I cannot control. When I publish the app, I will likely
            email the teacher, and include in there a request for her to
            update the URL on her site, and then at some point I'll phase
            this out.

            This page is meant to redirect you to the updated URL of
            the <i>The Master and Margarita</i> game and, evidently,
            something has gone wrong.
