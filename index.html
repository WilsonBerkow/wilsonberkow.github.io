            <hr style="width: 80%;" />

            <p>
                I am a senior at Stuyvesant High School in New York City,
                and have been writing software for years. I am
                the President of Software Engineering on the
                <a href="//stuypulse.com">Team 694 Robotics Team</a>.
                (Our code is all open-source and available
                <a href="//github.com/Team694">on GitHub</a>.)
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2016, Team 694 reached
                the world championship of <i>FIRST</i> Robotics and then
                went on to <i>Einstein</i>, the final competition between
                the victors of each of the eight divisions at the championship.
                This makes us the only active team in NYC to have gotten to
                Einstein. In the NYC Regional competition (a qualifier for
                the world championship), we won the <i>Engineering Inspiration</i>
                Award for, in part, the help we have offered to other teams, including
                in the <i>China Robotics Challenge</i>, and in the NYC Regional
                itself. We had a "Fix It crew" dedicated to aiding other
                teams, and although I was generally busy with my work for our
                own robot, I had a couple opportunities to help a couple other
                teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a passion for software development (and
                programming language design) which I have persued
                through personal projects.
